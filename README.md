# **Impact Of COVID-19 On Food-Security**

## Problem Description 
The COVID-19 outbreak has shaken up the economic sectors including the agriculture sector, food processing industries and food distribution industries. Hence, to meet the food demand of the population, the current food supply chain system and activities should be reconsidered. 

## Proposed Solution
Supply-demand forecasting helps to predict the gap between food production and consumption, i.e., food availability. This information can be visualized using a dashboard thus providing organisations insight on what business strategies to implement to ensure well supplied markets, access to affordable food and fully functioning agriculture businesses.
Furthermore, an analysis on the impact of the pandemic on food consumption/production patterns will help bring awareness to the populace about what measures are to be taken.

*Therefore, a possible solution to the prevailing problem of food security is to build an application that provides visual representations of real-time information about the agricultural produce, the rate of it's depletion, and also predicts the gap between demand and supply for the next cycle.*
